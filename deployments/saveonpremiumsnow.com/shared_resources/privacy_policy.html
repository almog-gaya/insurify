        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you visit the Sites, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Sites, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Sites, and information about how you interact with the Sites. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information."</p>
        
        <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

        <p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Sites. We also use third-party insurance providers to offer you insurance quotes and services.</p>
